This is a simple todo app.
Here you can add new todos, edit existing ones and delete them as well.
Create a new file named as .encv in the root directory of this project.
There enter `
DATABASE_URL='<Your Database URL Here>'
PORT=<Your Port Here>
`
To start the app just run 'npm install' in order to get all dependencies installed.  
And then do npm start in order to start the server and have it running on your localhost at port 3000 by default.
You are good to go!
